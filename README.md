# Sales-tax

Sales tax is collected from buyers and remitted to the government. A retailer has to file a monthly sales tax report which lists the sales for the month and the amount of sales ax collected, at both the county and state levels. Develop a program that will input the total col lections for a month, calculate the sales tax on the collections, and display the county and state taxes. Assume that states have a 4% sales tax and counties have a 5% sales tax.
